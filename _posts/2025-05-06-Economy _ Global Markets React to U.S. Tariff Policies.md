### Article

On May 6, 2025, global financial markets experienced heightened volatility in response to the U.S. administration's recent tariff implementations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.9%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each declined by 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively. These downturns are attributed to investor concerns over escalating trade tensions and their potential impact on corporate earnings.

The U.S. trade deficit reached a record $140.5 billion in March, intensifying fears of a prolonged trade war. In response, several companies have revised their financial forecasts, citing uncertainties stemming from the new tariff environment.

Internationally, the UK's business activity contracted for the first time since October 2023, with the services sector particularly affected. The S&P Global UK Services PMI dropped to 49.0, signaling a contraction as exports declined at the fastest rate since February 2021.

Amid these developments, investors are closely monitoring upcoming meetings between U.S. and Chinese officials in Switzerland, hoping for resolutions that could stabilize global markets.
