### Article

On May 9, 2025, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed the Fiscal Year 2026 state budget, unveiling a series of economic relief measures aimed at supporting middle- and low-income residents. A significant highlight is the introduction of "Inflation Refund" checks of up to $400, intended to alleviate the financial burden of rising living costs. Approximately eight million New Yorkers are expected to benefit from this initiative, funded by a $2 billion allocation.

The comprehensive $254 billion budget also encompasses a $1 billion tax cut for middle- and low-income earners, marking the lowest tax rates in 70 years. Additionally, the Child Tax Credit has been expanded, offering families with young children between $500 and $1,000. Other notable provisions include $340 million for free school meals, $77 million to enhance New York City's subway system, and $25 million to support homelessness services through welcome centers.

Governor Hochul emphasized that these measures fulfill her commitment to supporting families financially and enhancing public safety and infrastructure. Specific eligibility criteria and distribution timelines for the inflation checks are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.
