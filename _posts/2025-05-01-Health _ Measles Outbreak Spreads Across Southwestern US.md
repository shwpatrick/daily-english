As of April 30, 2025, a significant measles outbreak has affected several states in the southwestern United States, including Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas, with additional cases reported in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.

The resurgence of measles, a disease previously declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, is attributed to declining vaccination rates and increased vaccine hesitancy. Health officials are urging the public to ensure vaccinations are up to date to prevent further spread. In response to the outbreak, some communities have seen a rise in vaccination rates, while others continue to resist immunization efforts.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasizes the importance of the MMR vaccine in preventing measles and is working with state and local health departments to contain the outbreak and educate the public on the risks associated with non-vaccination.
