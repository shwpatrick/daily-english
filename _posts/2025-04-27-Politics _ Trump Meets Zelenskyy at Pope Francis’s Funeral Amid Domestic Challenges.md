### Article

On April 26, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump attended the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican, joining numerous global leaders in mourning the pontiff. Prior to the ceremony, Trump held a significant meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy—their first since a contentious exchange earlier this year. In a notable shift, Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin's missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians, suggesting a potential change in the U.S. approach to the ongoing conflict.​[YouTube+5衛報+5PBS: Public Broadcasting Service+5](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/27/president-trump-administration-news-updates-today?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Despite this diplomatic engagement, Trump's popularity at home continues to decline. Recent polls indicate growing dissatisfaction among Republicans, fueled by concerns over his administration's focus and a series of controversies. These include the wrongful deportation of U.S. citizens, the arrest of a federal judge related to immigration enforcement, and internal disruptions within the Pentagon under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Additionally, Trump's controversial pardon of a Las Vegas politician convicted of fraud has drawn criticism, even from his supporters. National issues such as an escalating measles outbreak and the death of Jeffrey Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre have further complicated the political landscape.​[衛報+1Latest news & breaking headlines+1](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/27/president-trump-administration-news-updates-today?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
