---

### Article

On April 14, 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated a Section 232 investigation to assess the impact of pharmaceutical imports on national security. This inquiry encompasses finished drug products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and key starting materials. The investigation aims to determine whether reliance on foreign sources for these critical components poses a threat to the nation's health infrastructure.

The Department is soliciting public comments on various aspects, including the domestic production capacity, supply chain vulnerabilities, and potential risks associated with import dependencies. The findings, expected within 270 days, will guide the President in deciding whether to implement measures to mitigate identified risks.

This move reflects growing concerns about the resilience of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain, especially in light of recent global disruptions. Strengthening domestic manufacturing capabilities is seen as a strategic priority to ensure the availability of essential medicines during emergencies.
