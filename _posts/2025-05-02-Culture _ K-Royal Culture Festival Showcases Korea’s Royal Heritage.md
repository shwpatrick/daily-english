### Article

The 2025 Spring K-Royal Culture Festival, South Korea’s largest cultural heritage celebration, is underway in Seoul from April 26 to May 4. Spanning five grand palaces—Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Deoksugung, Changgyeonggung, and Gyeonghuigung—as well as Jongmyo Shrine, the festival offers over 40 programs that immerse visitors in Korea’s royal traditions.

This year, the festival has expanded its offerings for international visitors. Programs such as “The Emperor’s Dining Table” at Deoksugung Palace allow guests to sample royal cuisine while learning about palace life in English. Other experiences include hanbok rentals, daenggi (traditional hair ribbon) workshops, and nighttime tours highlighting King Sejong’s achievements.

Art enthusiasts can explore the “Embracing: Palace Atmospheres” exhibition at Changgyeonggung Palace, featuring works inspired by royal culture. The festival aims to deepen appreciation for Korea’s history among both locals and tourists.
