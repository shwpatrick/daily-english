Article
On April 29, 2025, LG Electronics and Taiwan’s MediaTek announced a collaborative breakthrough in automotive technology at Auto Shanghai 2025. The two companies unveiled a next-generation in-vehicle infotainment system that integrates MediaTek’s “Dimension Auto Platform” with LG’s Android-based automotive operating system.

This innovative system allows multiple passengers to access different content simultaneously across several displays, all powered by a single chip and operating system. The design aims to enhance user experience while reducing hardware complexity and cost.

The partnership reflects LG’s strategic shift toward vehicle components following its exit from the smartphone market in 2021. By collaborating with MediaTek, LG strengthens its position in the growing market for software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where seamless digital experiences are becoming a key differentiator.

The unveiling also underscores Taiwan’s expanding role in global automotive innovation, as MediaTek continues to extend its semiconductor expertise beyond mobile devices into the automotive sector.
