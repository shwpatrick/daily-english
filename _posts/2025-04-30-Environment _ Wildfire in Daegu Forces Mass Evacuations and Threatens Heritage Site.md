### Article

On April 28, 2025, a massive wildfire erupted on Mount Hamji in Daegu, South Korea, rapidly spreading due to dry conditions and strong winds. The blaze consumed approximately 260 hectares of forest, equivalent to about 364 football fields, and prompted the evacuation of over 2,000 residents. Authorities deployed 53 helicopters and more than 1,500 firefighters to combat the fire, which was fully extinguished after 23 hours on April 29 .

The fire's proximity to residential areas led to the closure of sections of the Gyeongbu Expressway and raised concerns about the potential damage to the ancient Palgongsan Fortress, a cultural heritage site dating back to the 5th century. While initial assessments suggest minimal impact on the fortress, detailed evaluations are ongoing. The cause of the wildfire remains under investigation, with officials not ruling out human factors .
