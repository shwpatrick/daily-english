### Article

On May 7, 2025, India initiated "Operation Sindoor," a series of precision strikes targeting alleged terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The operation, lasting approximately 23 minutes, involved Rafale jets deploying SCALP missiles and AASM Hammer bombs. India asserted that the strikes aimed at infrastructure used by groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, emphasizing that no Pakistani military facilities were targeted.

In response, Pakistan claimed to have shot down multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafale and MiG-29 jets, and reported civilian casualties due to the strikes. The situation escalated with cross-border shelling, resulting in additional civilian deaths on both sides. International leaders, including UN Secretary-General António Guterres, urged restraint to prevent further deterioration of regional stability.

The conflict has raised concerns over the potential for broader military engagement between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, highlighting the fragile nature of peace in the region.
