title: "2025-04-26 _ Technology _ Apple Revises AI Marketing After Watchdog Criticism"
---

### Article

Apple has amended its marketing materials for "Apple Intelligence" following scrutiny from the National Advertising Division (NAD), a self-regulatory body under the Better Business Bureau. The NAD found that Apple's use of the phrase "Available now" in promoting its AI features was misleading, as several functionalities were not accessible at the time of the iPhone 16 launch in September 2024. Features like Priority Notifications, Genmoji, Image Playground, and ChatGPT integration were rolled out gradually between October 2024 and March 2025, with some, such as the enhanced Siri, still pending release. 

In response, Apple removed the "Available now" claim from its website and discontinued the "More Personal Siri" advertisement. While the company disagreed with the NAD's conclusions, it stated its intention to comply with the recommendations. ​

This incident underscores the importance of accurate marketing in the tech industry, especially when introducing advanced AI features that significantly impact user experience.​
