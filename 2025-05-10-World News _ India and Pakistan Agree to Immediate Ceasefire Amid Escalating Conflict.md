---

### Article

On May 10, 2025, India and Pakistan reached an immediate ceasefire agreement following one of the most severe military escalations between the two nations in decades. The conflict, ignited by a deadly militant attack in Kashmir, led to a series of cross-border strikes targeting military bases on both sides. India accused Pakistan of supporting militant groups, while Pakistan retaliated with airstrikes codenamed "Operation Bunyan Ul Marsoos" after India allegedly launched missile attacks against its airbases, including one near Islamabad.

The hostilities resulted in over 60 civilian deaths and widespread panic across multiple cities. International actors, including the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, facilitated mediation efforts. U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the ceasefire, with foreign ministers from both India and Pakistan concurring on the agreement.

Despite the ceasefire, underlying tensions persist, highlighted by the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Pakistan reopened its airspace after a brief closure, and celebrations erupted across Pakistani cities. India denied targeting religious sites, refuting Pakistani claims. The international community, including the G7, urged restraint and a peaceful resolution, warning of the regional and global risks posed by the confrontation between the nuclear-armed rivals.
